# EAT DA BURGER!!

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
# Material used in this project
The app will store every burger in a database. Devoured or not.

# Challenges

The challenges that I came across while working on this application was geting my button.js to function with my application. I tried adding my button.js file in the routes of my serer.js files. But when I ran the code through node.js, it came out as $ not defined. I double-checked my main.handlebars and put the jquery link first, but the same syntax error still kept coming up. I am still working on that. I also had difficulties uploading my app to heroku. For some reason, when connected Mysql to Heroku, MY application freezes and I get an error. Going to talk to the talk to my TA's on whats going on with the application at Heroku. But overall there is still work that needs to be done. Updates coming soon.
